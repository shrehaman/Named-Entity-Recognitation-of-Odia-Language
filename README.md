# Named Entity Recognitation of Odia Language

The Named Entity Recognition (NER) project in Odia language using Field Dog Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on classifying entities within a paragraph into three classes: name, location, and organization. By leveraging various machine learning techniques, the project aims to accurately identify and classify these entities, providing valuable insights for information extraction and text analysis tasks in the Odia language.

Key features of the Named Entity Recognition project include:

- Odia language support: The project is specifically designed to work with the Odia language, enabling the recognition and classification of entities in Odia text data.
- Field of NLP: The project utilizes the NLP filed, a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks.NLP offers a range of functionalities, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
- Entity classes: The project focuses on three primary entity classes: name, location, and organization. These classes cover a wide range of entities that are commonly encountered in text data.
- Machine learning techniques: The project leverages various machine learning techniques, such as rule-based models, statistical models, or deep learning models, to perform named entity recognition. The choice of techniques can be tailored based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the Odia language.
- Training and evaluation: The project includes processes for training and evaluating the named entity recognition models. This involves preparing annotated training data, selecting appropriate features, and optimizing the models for improved accuracy and performance.
- Application potential: The named entity recognition models developed in this project have potential applications in information retrieval, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and various other text mining tasks in the Odia language.

The Named Entity Recognition in Odia Language using Field Dog NLP project offers a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts interested in working with Odia text data and extracting meaningful information from it.
